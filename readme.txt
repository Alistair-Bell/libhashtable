================================
Simple Hashtable implimentation.
================================

Use for embedding within aplications, this program compiles to an object archive.
Originally built within my holyc compiler but proved to be useful enough for other projects.

Configuration
-------------

All the sources and headers include an src/inc.h header.
This provides some basic configuration for the program.
src/inc.h can be a symbolic link to the larger project inc header.


Building
--------

`make all`
